Created a MySQL database that stores students' personal information along with the courses they have finished.

Established connectivity between Python and the MySQL database using the python-mysql-connector library, and displayed the data on a webpage using Flask.

To view the result, enter the command "python ./app.py" in the terminal, and then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.
